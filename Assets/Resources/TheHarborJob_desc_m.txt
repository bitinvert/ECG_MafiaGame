Hey Boss, our man at the docks Dino Scarbonelli told me about an opportunity to make some money. 
There are at least three safes full of jewelry, drugs and hard cash  located at the harbor area. 
Which of our guys are the right ones for this job? You might need a safecracker and some gun power. 
Be aware of the cops, it might be a trap. Crack the safes. Get the loot to your escape point. 
Protect the carriers. If they die, their treasure is lost.
