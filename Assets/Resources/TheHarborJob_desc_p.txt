Sir, my informer Dino Scarbonelli told me about a huge load of illegal merchandise at the harbour area. 
There are at least three safes full of jewelry, drugs and hard cash. 
We should get there quick, confiscate the stuff and bust the bad guys. 
I think we need some specialists for this task. 
At least an officer who knows how to deal with a picklock and some protection. 
Crack the safes. Get the illegal merchandise to your escape point. 
Protect the carriers. If they die, their treasure is lost.
